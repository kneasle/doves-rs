# Dove's Guide for Rust

A tiny Rust crate to read [Dove's Guide for Church Bell Ringers](https://dove.cccbr.org.uk/).

Currently, this library only supports reading `dove.csv` (i.e. the tower list) but support for other
Dove's data will be implemented if required.  Note that this library doesn't come bundled with data
from Dove's; data should be downloaded from the Dove's guide
[download page](https://dove.cccbr.org.uk/downloads.php).
